## If Repository Already Exists

If you already have a remote repository set up:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update DSA platform with deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

## Verify Upload

After pushing, your repository should contain:
- README.md with setup instructions

## Test the Setup

Others can now clone and run your platform:
